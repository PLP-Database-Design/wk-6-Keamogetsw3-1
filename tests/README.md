## 🎯 Purpose

The purpose of the **tests** folder is to:

- Maintain structured and traceable test documentation  
- Ensure coverage of functional, non-functional, boundary and risk-based testing  
- Provide clear test cases mapped to requirements and risk IDs  
- Track execution status and defect links
