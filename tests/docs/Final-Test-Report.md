## Defect Analysis and Categorization
During the test execution phase (Phase 3) of the CleanCity project, defects were systematically identified, recorded and analysed to ensure the software met its functional and non-functional requirements. The testing team executed manual and automated test cases of the following fueatures of the application; authentication, dashboard functionality, waste pickup scheduling and accessibility.

Defects were categorized based on:
| **Severity** | **Description**                                                                                           |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Critical     | Defects that impacts core functionality; must be fixed immediately.  |
| Major        | Defects that affect important features or workflows, but the system is still usable; should be addressed soon.          |
| Minor        | A medium defect appears when the system doesn’t meet certain criteria or exhibits some strange behaviours; functionality is not impacted |
| Cosmetic     | Visual or UI issues; do not affect system operation. |
