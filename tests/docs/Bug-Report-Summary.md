## 🐛 Reported Bugs

### 🐞 BUG-001
**Title:** Profile shows email username instead of Full Name after registration  
**GitHub Link:** #28  
**Requirement Affected:** User Registration – Profile Display  
**Severity:** Low  
**Environment:** Development, Google Chrome, Windows 10  

#### Summary
After registering a new user with a proper Full Name, the profile page displays the username portion of the email (e.g., `user1` from `newuser@test.com`) instead of the Full Name (`New Test User`) provided during registration. This may cause confusion for users, as the system does not reflect the actual name they entered.

#### Steps to Reproduce
1. Register a new user with:
   - **Full Name:** `New Test User`
   - **Email:** `newuser@test.com`
   - **Password:** `NewPass123`
2. Log in with the newly registered account.  
3. Navigate to the **User Profile** page.  
4. Observe that the profile shows the email username instead of the Full Name.

#### Expected Result
The profile page should display the **Full Name** entered during registration.

#### Actual Result
The profile page displays the **username derived from the email** instead of the Full Name.

### 🐞 BUG-002  
**Title:** Existing user can log in with a different password than the one used during registration  
**GitHub Link:** [#31](https://github.com/Keamogetsw3/CleanCity-Waste_Pickup_Scheduler-QATesting/issues/31)  
**Requirement Affected:** User Login – Authentication  
**Severity:** Critical  
**Environment:** Development, Google Chrome, Windows 10  

#### Summary
An existing user is able to log in using a completely different password than the one set during registration. This is a major security issue because it allows unauthorized access to accounts, bypassing the intended authentication mechanism.  

#### Steps to Reproduce
1. Register a new user with:  
   - Full Name: Test User  
   - Email: user1@test.com
   - Password: TestPass123  
2. Log out of the account.  
3. Attempt to log in using the same email but a completely different password (e.g., WrongPassword).  
4. Observe that the system allows login despite the incorrect password.  

#### Expected Result
The system should reject login attempts when the password does not match the one used during registration, displaying an error: "Invalid email or password."  

#### Actual Result
The system allows the user to log in even with a password different from the one set during registration.

### 🐞 BUG-003  
**Title:** System allows login with unregistered credentials  
**GitHub Link:** [#32](https://github.com/Keamogetsw3/CleanCity-Waste_Pickup_Scheduler-QATesting/issues/32)  
**Requirement Affected:** User Login – Authentication Validation  
**Severity:** Critical  
**Environment:** Development, Google Chrome, Windows 10  

#### Summary
The system successfully logs in users even when the provided email and password do not belong to any registered account. This issue completely bypasses the authentication process and poses a severe security risk, as unauthorized users can gain access without registration.  

#### Steps to Reproduce
1. Open the login page.  
2. Enter credentials that do not exist in the system, for example:  
   - Email: nonexist@test.com  
   - Password: AnyPassword  
3. Click **Login**.  
4. Observe that the system logs the user in successfully.  

#### Expected Result
The system should validate user credentials against the database and display an error message:  
> “Invalid email or password.”  

#### Actual Result
The system allows login and grants access even though the credentials are not registered in the database.

### 🐞 BUG-004  
**Title:** Pick-up request submitted without user registration  
**GitHub Link:** [#33](https://github.com/Keamogetsw3/CleanCity-Waste_Pickup_Scheduler-QATesting/issues/33)  
**Requirement Affected:** Pick-up Request – User Authentication  
**Severity:** High  
**Environment:** Development, Google Chrome, Windows 10  

#### Summary
The system allows a user to submit a waste pick-up request **without registering or logging in**, which violates the functional requirement that all pick-ups must be performed by authenticated users.

#### Steps to Reproduce
1. Open the CleanCity application.  
2. Navigate to the pick-up request form.  
3. Fill in valid pick-up details.  
4. Submit the request **without creating an account or logging in**.  

#### Expected Result
The system should **prevent submission** and prompt the user to register or log in before creating a pick-up request.  

#### Actual Result
The pick-up request is successfully submitted without any authentication.
